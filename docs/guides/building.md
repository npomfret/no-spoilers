# Building Guide

Canonical build and compile policy for this repo.

## Rules

- Use the repo's approved build and verification entry points.
- If the repo has not standardized wrappers yet, verify the real Swift package or Xcode entry point before running anything.
- Choose the smallest meaningful build or compile scope first.
- Do not bypass build failures or toolchain errors.
- Report exact commands and outcomes.

## Current state

- The Swift build surface is not fully defined yet.
- When the main package/project lands, update this guide with the canonical commands and schemes.
