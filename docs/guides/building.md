# Building Guide

Canonical build and compile policy for this repo.

## Rules

- Use the repo's approved build and verification entry points.
- If the repo has not standardized wrappers yet, verify the real Swift package or Xcode entry point before running anything.
- Choose the smallest meaningful build or compile scope first.
- Do not bypass build failures or toolchain errors.
- Report exact commands and outcomes.

## Current state

- Canonical build wrappers live in `scripts/` and force HOME/Foundation home, DerivedData, SwiftPM scratch space, source packages, and module caches into repo-local `tmp/` paths.
- Use `scripts/verify-mac-build.sh` for the macOS app build. It builds scheme `NoSpoilers` for `generic/platform=macOS`.
- Use `scripts/verify-ios-build.sh` for the iOS app build. It builds scheme `NoSpoilersApp` for `generic/platform=iOS`; if that scheme is absent, stop and inspect the real shared schemes before substituting another command.
- Use `scripts/verify-widget-build.sh` for the widget extension build. It builds target `NoSpoilersWidgetExtension` with Debug `iphoneos` settings and target-build-compatible output paths.
- Do not replace these wrappers with ad-hoc `xcodebuild` invocations unless the wrapper is wrong for the touched scope; update the wrapper instead when a command becomes canonical.
